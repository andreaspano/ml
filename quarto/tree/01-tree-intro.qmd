## Introduction
-   Decision Tree is one of the commonly used exploratory data analysis and objective segmentation techniques.

-   Great advantage with Decision Tree is that its output is relatively easy to understand or interpret.

-   A decision tree is a **recursive hierarchical partitioning** of the input data: at each node (step) a specific value of a single independent variables is used for the partition.

## Introduction
-   Tree-based methods can be used for both
    -   **Classification**: Categorical response variable 
         - Binary Response Variable
         - Multi Class Response Variable
    -   **Regression**: Continuos response variable 
- Explanatory variables can be both 
   - Categorical 
      - Binary
      - Multi Class
   - Continuos


## Note
- We will first analyse Classification tree with:
   - Binary response variable
   - Binary regressors
- We will expand later on  


## Tree Building 

-   The building of a tree is usually produced in two phases:

    -   *Growth*
    -   *Pruning*.

-   To grow a tree, at each step, a binary splitting is used.
-   To prune a tree, at ech step, at list a binary split is pruned
